This was a four-part series on the impact of busing on the public schools...\\nI have two positions available. One is assistant to the road test editor of Auto Universe magazine.\\n And the other one--?\\nHi, I have an appointment with Emily Charlton--\\nOkay, so... I was Miranda\\'s second assistant, but her first assistant recently got promoted so now I\\'m the first...\\nAnd you\\'re replacing yourself.\\nI\\'m trying. Miranda sacked the last two girls after only a few weeks. We need to find someone who can survive here. Do you understand?\\nYes. Of course. Who\\'s Miranda?\\n You didn\\'t just ask me that. She\\'s the editor in chief of Runway. Not to mention a legend. Work a year for her and you can get a job at any magazine you want. A million girls would kill for this job.\\nSounds great. I\\'d love to be considered.\\nAndrea, Runway is a fashion magazine. An interest in fashion is crucial.\\nWhat makes you think I\\'m not interested in fashion?\\nOh my God. No. No, no, no.\\nWhat\\'s wrong?\\n She\\'s on her way -- tell everyone!\\nHer driver text-messaged. Her facialist ruptured a disk. God, these people!\\nAll right, everyone. Man your battle stations!  Did somebody eat an onion bagel?\\nSorry, Miranda.\\nOh no. You\\'re still here. Go.\\n Wow, this is like self-esteem camp.\\nI don\\'t understand why it\\'s so difficult to confirm an appointment.\\nI\\'m so sorry, Miranda. I did confirm last night, but--\\nThe details of your incompetence do not interest me.\\nRight.\\nAnd tell Richard I saw the pictures of for the feature on female paramedics and they\\'re all so unattractive. I don\\'t understand. How hard is it to find a decent-looking paramedic?... Also, I need to see what Nigel has called in for Gwyneth\\'s second cover try...\\nNobody. Human resources sent her up about the assistant job and I was pre- interviewing her for you, but--\\nI\\'ll do it. The last two you sent me were total disappointments. Send her in.\\nShe wants to see you.. Go go go....\\nWho are you?\\nMy name is Andy Sachs. I recently graduated from--\\nWhat are you doing here?\\nI think I could do a good job as your assistant and--\\nSo you don\\'t read Runway?\\nNo.\\nAnd before today, you had never heard of me?\\nNo.\\nAnd you have no style or sense of fashion.\\nThat depends on--\\nThat wasn\\'t a question.\\nI was Editor in Chief of the Daily Northwestern. I won a national competition for college journalists with a series on the janitor\\'s union --\\nThat\\'s all.\\n--that uncovered the exploitation of--\\nWe got the exclusive on the yellow Cavalli for Gwyneth, the one he showed with a huge feathered headpiece, but she\\'ll look like she\\'s working the mainstage at the Golden Nugget, so instead...\\n Thank you for your time.\\nWho IS that sad little person? Are we doing a Before and After piece I don\\'t know about?\\nAndrea!\\nWow. You got a job at a fashion magazine.  Was it a phone interview?\\nDon\\'t be a jerk.\\nMiranda Priestly is famous for being unpredictable.\\nOkay, how is it that you know who she is and I didn\\'t?\\nI\\'m actually a girl.\\nThat would explain so much.\\nSeriously, Miranda is a huge deal. I bet a million girls would kill for that job.\\nYeah, it\\'s just that I\\'m not one of them.\\nYou have to start somewhere. Look at this dump Nate works in. Paper napkins? Hello?\\n What the hell is it that you do?\\nLucky for me, I have my dream job.\\n You\\'re a corporate research analyst.\\n-- which totally rocks. The free bagels on Thursday? The booze? The whores?\\nYou should see the way the girls dress at Runway. I\\'m not sure I have anything to wear to work.\\nYou\\'re going to be answering phones and getting coffee. You need a ballgown for that?\\nI think I might.\\nI think you look great. Always.\\nYou are so full of it.\\nCome on. Let\\'s go home. I can think of something you can do without clothes.\\nHello? Now?\\nMiranda decided to kill the Autumn Jacket story for September -- she\\'s pulling up the Sedona shoot from October. You need to go into the office right this second. Pick up her coffee order on the way. Write this down.\\nWhere are you?\\nI\\'m almost there.\\nNo...\\nYes. She gave me the job.\\nClearly my opinion means nothing.  Wow. It\\'s like Oklahoma and New Jersey had a baby out of wedlock.\\nActually, I\\'m from Cincinnati.\\nNo, it\\'s not possible. Not you.\\nIs there a reason my coffee is not here? Was I unclear in some way?\\nI hope you know this is a very difficult job for which you are totally wrong and if you mess up MY head is on the chopping block.\\nWhat if the building\\'s on fire or my appendix explodes or something?\\nOne time an assistant left the desk because she sliced her hand open with a letter opener. Miranda missed Lagerfeld right before he boarded a 17 hour flight to Australia. She now works at TV Guide.\\nMan the desk at all times. Got it.\\nMiranda Priestly\\'s office. She\\'s not available. I\\'ll tell her you called. Yet again.  I get to go with her to Paris for Fashion Week in the fall.\\nHow do I prove I\\'m not a psycho?\\nI have no idea.\\nWait. What do I do if--\\nRun-through at 3, shoot 8 am tomorrow. Of course. No problem.\\nHi, I\\'m Andy, I\\'m the new--\\nGreat. Fantastic. If you\\'ll excuse me, I gotta go pull a bunch of fringe purses out of my ass.\\nThat\\'s very nice of you, but I don\\'t need those. Miranda hired me. She knows what I look like.\\nDo you?\\nEmily!\\nShe means you.  Go.\\nIt\\'s too dark. I can\\'t see any of the clothes...\\n...I think he intended to use shadow to show the contours of the...\\nAnd what is this? I want the title of the layout to bleed over the left side of the photo...\\nI see, well, we needed room for the typeface to pick up the lines of the dress, which is cut on the bias, so we...\\nNo, no, no. That\\'s not what I want. I made that abundantly clear...\\nActually, it\\'s Andy.\\nWhat a fantastic story. So entertaining and full of useful information.\\nWhat kind of--\\nPlease bore someone else with your questions. Make sure we can get Pier 59 at 8 am tomorrow... Remind Jocelyn I want to see a few of those satchels Marc is doing in the pony... And tell Simone I\\'ll take Frankie if Maggie is not available tomorrow... And did Demarchelier confirm?\\nDemar--\\nGet him on the phone.\\nYes?\\nDo you have Demarchelier?\\nDemarchelier... Demarchelier...\\nI have Miranda Priestly calling.  I have Patrick.\\nShe called me in and asked me about Pier 59. She said something about Simone and Frankie and someone else. And she needs skirts from Calvin Klein. I think that\\'s the most important thing, but I couldn\\'t tell. Oh, and there was something about a pony.\\nDid she say which skirts? \\nI tried to ask her, but--\\nYou never ask Miranda. Anything.  All right, I\\'ll take care of the other stuff. You go to Calvin Klein.\\nMe?\\nI\\'m sorry. Do you have a prior commitment? Is there some hideous pants convention?\\nSo I just, what, go down to the Calvin Klein store and ask them--\\nYou\\'re not going to the store.\\nOf course not. I\\'m going... to his house.\\n You are catching on quickly. We always send assistants to a designer\\'s home on their very first day. You\\'re going to his showroom. I\\'ll give you the address.\\nSorry. Got it. What\\'s the nearest subway stop?\\nGood God. You do not. Under any circumstances. Take public transportation.\\nMiranda\\'s new assistant. Congrats.\\nThanks.\\nYou know--\\nYou\\'re going to say a million girls would kill for my job.\\nActually, I was going to say those Jelly Beans are seven years old.\\nI\\'m about to walk in. I\\'ll call you as soon as--\\nYou must be new. Congratulations. People would KILL for your job. I would. I love Miranda. She\\'s such an icon. I\\'ve dealt with her a couple times, but I\\'m sure she doesn\\'t remember.\\nThere\\'s a um, variety of skirts. Let\\'s see...\\nI\\'m sorry. What\\'s your name?\\nLiz.\\nIt\\'s Liz.\\n What did she say?\\n Is Ivan in by any chance?\\n I\\'ll get him.\\nOh my God. What took you so long? I have to pee.\\nYou haven\\'t peed since I left?\\nYou do the coat.\\nThe run-through. Right.\\n The editors bring in options for a shoot and Miranda chooses. She chooses every single thing in every single issue. Run-throughs are a huge deal.\\nIs it always like this?\\nNo. Sometimes it\\'s busy.\\nI thought you were kidding.\\nOh, no. I was quite serious.\\nYou eat lunch?\\nCorn chowder. Interesting choice.\\nNone of the girls here eat anything?\\nNot since 2 became the new 4 and 0\\nOkay. You think my clothes are hideous. I get it, okay?  But I\\'m not going to be working in fashion forever. I don\\'t see any reason to change everything about myself because I have this job.\\nYou\\'re right. That\\'s what this multi- million dollar industry is all about. Inner beauty.\\nMr. Ravitz.\\nNigel.    Issue going well?\\nOur biggest September ever.\\nGreat. I heard Miranda killed Autumn Jackets and pulled up the Sedona shoot. What\\'s that costing me?\\n Must have been some lousy Jackets. But I\\'m sure she knows what she\\'s doing.\\nAlways.\\nIrv Ravitz.\\nI\\'m sorry... this is Andy Sachs, Miranda\\'s new assistant.\\nCongratulations, young lady. A million girls would kill for that job.\\n We should have taken the stairs.\\nNo... No... No... I swear I don\\'t understand why it\\'s so difficult for you to pull together a decent run- through. You had hours to prepare...  Where are all the advertisers?\\nWe have some pieces from Banana Republic and--\\nWe need more.\\nYou know me. A full ballerina skirt with a hint of saloon and I\\'m on board.\\nIs it too much like the--\\n--LaCroix from July? I thought of that, but with the right accessories, it could work...\\nWhere are the belts for this skirt?\\nTough call. They\\'re so different.\\nIs something funny?\\nNo, no, no. It\\'s just...\\nThis... stuff? Okay. I understand. You think this has nothing to do with you. You go to your closet and select, say, that lumpy blue sweater because you\\'re trying to tell the world that you take yourself too seriously to care about what\\'s on your body. What you don\\'t know is that your sweater is not blue. It\\'s not even sky blue. It\\'s cerulean. You also don\\'t know that in 2002, De La Renta did a collection of cerulean gowns, Yves St. Laurent showed a cerulean military jacket, Dolce did skirts with cerulean beads, and in our September issue we did the definitive layout on the color. Cerulean quickly appeared in eight other major collections, then the secondary and department store lines and then trickled down to some lovely Casual Corner, where you no doubt stumbled on it. \\nYou should have seen the look she gave me. I thought the flesh was going to melt off her face.\\nGimme that. There\\'s about eight dollars worth of Jarlsberg in there.\\nI just have to stick it out for one year. Then I can do what I came to New York to do. I can\\'t let Miranda get to me. I won\\'t.\\nEasy, Killer.\\nAnd give me that sandwich.\\nOh, no way. It\\'s mine now.\\nGood morning, Miranda!\\nGet me Isaac.\\nThese eggs are frigid.\\nPick up the Polaroids from the swimwear shoot.\\nThe brakes in my car are making a weird noise. Take it in.\\nWe need the hat from the finale of the Zac Posen show. 32. The Devil Wears Prada   2nd Blue In Progress   12/00/05\\nThe girls need new boogieboards for spring break.\\nPick up my shoes from Manolo.\\n...and while you\\'re out, get Patricia.\\nGet me Isaac!\\nI have Isaac.\\nYes.\\nDad! I\\'ll be right down!\\nHere. Don\\'t want you to get behind in your rent.\\nHow did you--  I\\'m gonna kill Mom. Thank you.\\n Thought I\\'d let you at least enjoy the bread basket first.\\n Oh, just go ahead.\\nWe\\'re just a little worried. We get emails from you at your office at 2 am, your pay is terrible, you don\\'t get to write anything...\\n Hey. Not fair. I wrote those e- mails.\\nI\\'m just trying to understand why someone who was accepted to Stanford Law turns that down to be a journalist and now you\\'re not even doing that--\\nOh please. Not this again.\\nWhy did you even bother applying to law school?\\nBecause it\\'s what you wanted. This is what I want.\\nThis? Being a secretary?\\nI\\'m an executive assistant.\\nYou hang coats, you go to Starbucks, you\\'re a secretary, Andy.\\nYou have to trust me. Being Miranda\\'s assistant opens a lot of doors. Emily is going to Paris with Miranda in a few months, she\\'ll meet editors and writers from every important magazine.\\nMy flight is cancelled... Some absurd weather problem.\\nAbsolutely, Miranda. Let me see what I can do.\\nI need a jet from Miami to New York...  I\\'m trying, Miranda. No one is flying out because of the weather.\\nPlease. It\\'s just drizzling. Someone must be getting out. Call Donatella and get her jet. Call everyone with a jet -- Irv, Armani...\\nAndy, come on. Let\\'s go in.\\nI\\'ve done everything I could think of. I don\\'t know what else to do.\\nEmily. Stop making excuses. GET ME HOME.\\nOh my God. She is going to murder me.\\nWould it help if I talked to her?\\nThe girls\\' recital was wonderful. They played Rachmaninoff and everyone loved it. Except for me... because I was not there.\\nI\\'m so sorry, Miranda.\\nDo you know why I hired you?\\nI did everything I could think of--\\nThat\\'s all.\\nExcuse me, where do you think you--\\nShe hates me, Nigel.\\nAnd that\\'s my problem because -- wait, no. Not my problem.\\nI need your help. I don\\'t know what to do. It\\'s like I\\'m completely beneath her contempt.\\nSo quit.\\nThat\\'s not fair. I\\'m lucky to be working for Miranda -- I didn\\'t get that at first, but I do now. I want to be here. But it just seems like no matter how hard I try, I don\\'t do anything right.\\nAndy, please. Be serious. You\\'re not trying. You\\'re whining.\\nOkay, fine!\\nOh, no. No way...\\nYou do it with the other girls.\\nThe other girls are different. They really want it.\\nPlease, Nigel. Don\\'t make me beg...\\nI don\\'t know what you expect me to do.\\nA... poncho?\\nYou\\'ll take what I give you and you\\'ll like it.\\nI have no idea why Miranda hired her.\\nMe, neither. The other day we were in the Beauty Department and she held up the Shu Uemura eyelash curler and said \"What is this?\"\\nI knew from the moment I saw her that she was a complete and utter--\\nMiranda Priestly\\'s office. She\\'s not in. I\\'ll leave word.\\nWhat do you think?\\nI think we better get out of here before my girlfriend sees me with you.\\nWanna lift, stranger?\\nThe gowns are fabulous, Ralph. We\\'re using the burgundy for the cover try and the lemon chiffon for the goddess story.\\nBang & Olufsen. Charlie Rose sent it to Miranda for her birthday. \\nAll for a woman who doesn\\'t need anything. Perfect.\\nHere... A bunch of Kiehl\\'s, some Mason Pearson hair brushes...\\nDammit, I love your job.\\nIt\\'s called \"Pink\". For women.\\nMen can be pink. I have a pink side.\\nPlease. We\\'re eating.\\nSure you can.\\nWhy do women need so many bags? You get one, it holds all your junk, aren\\'t you done?\\nFashion is not about utility, Nate. An accessory is merely a piece of iconography used to express individual identity.\\nAnd it\\'s preeeetty.\\nThat too.\\nThing is, it turns out there\\'s a lot more to Runway than fancy purses... you know who\\'s coming into the office Friday? John Updike.\\nWhy, does he need a sweater?\\n Look, there\\'s a piece by Jay McInerney, an essay by Joan Didion, an interview with Christiane Amanpour oh...\\nLook who\\'s drinking the KoolAid.\\nGive me the phone.\\nOh, look. The Dragon Lady. Of course.\\nGive me the phone.\\nI\\'ll talk to her. Tell her she needs to get her own scrambled eggs.\\nCome on, guys. Give me the phone!\\nI\\'m looking for James Holt...\\nYou must be the new Emily. Let me see.\\nYou.\\nDuh.\\nI\\'ll guard it with my life.\\nCome on. You work for Miranda, you must be in desperate need of hard liquor.\\nHe\\'s right. I had the punch at James\\'s last party, woke up in Hoboken wearing nothing but boxers and a cowboy hat.\\nHi. I, um... I have to go.\\nBut you want to stay. You\\'ve never been to a party like this.\\nGod, I love it when total strangers tell me how I feel.\\nThat\\'s my way.  Christian Thompson.\\nChristian Thompson? You\\'re kidding. You write for every magazine I love. I actually reviewed your collection of essays for my college paper.\\nDid you mention my good looks and killer charm?\\nNo, but I did point out some factual errors and a penchant for confessional semi-fiction that borders on self-indulgent.\\nYou and the Times.  And what do you do?\\nWell, I want to work somewhere like the New Yorker or Vanity Fair. I\\'m also a writer, but--\\nIs that right? I should read your stuff. Send it over.\\nThank you. That would be great. Anyway, for now I\\'m Miranda Priestly\\'s assistant.\\nYou\\'re kidding. Oh, that\\'s too bad. You\\'ll never survive Miranda.\\nExcuse me?\\nYou\\'re smart, you\\'re nice, you have a point of view. You can\\'t do that job.\\nI have to go.\\nLet me guess. You have a boyfriend waiting. From... not high school... college? Nice-looking guy, devoted, about to ask you to move in with him, but you\\'re not sure...\\nYou. Are not a nice person.\\nNice to meet you, Miranda girl.\\nFor your information, he\\'s really handsome. And we already live together!\\nYou got the nuclear briefcase from the undisclosed location. I\\'m proud of you.\\n Where are you going?\\nDoug and some of his banker buddies are playing Texas Hold `Em at his apartment. Gonna go get me some of that Wall Street cash.\\nBut I came back so we could hang out.\\n Man, I\\'m sorry. You didn\\'t make that crystal clear when you stormed off after calling me an asshole.\\nOkay, look, I\\'m sorry about that--\\nI\\'ll see you later, okay?\\nEmily!\\nThey\\'re not expecting us until Tuesday. Did she say why?\\nYes, she explained every detail of her decision-making, then we brushed each other\\'s hair and gabbed about American Idol.\\nI see your point.\\nJust let us out here.\\nAnd then there\\'s the pursing of the lips.\\nWhat does that mean?\\nCatastrophe.\\nLast time I was here, James was having this cool party and--  --and this is why you don\\'t like people riding up in the elevator with you.\\nMiranda. Great to see you.\\nYes. I did.\\nThis season I started to think about the intersection of East and West...\\n She pursed her lips and because of that he\\'s going to change his entire collection?\\nYou still don\\'t get it, do you? Her opinion is the only one that matters.\\nMake sure you confirm my dinner with--\\n--Galliano at Pastis. Done.\\nAnd I need to see the look book for the November denim shoot.\\nIt\\'s in the car.\\nFine.\\nGuard this with your life.\\nOf course. If I can deliver the Book, that means I must have done something right, that she doesn\\'t think I\\'m psycho. Oh, and she actually called me Andrea instead of Emily. Isn\\'t that great?\\n Yeah. Whoopee. Okay, now, it\\'s very important that you do EXACTLY what I\\'m about to tell you.\\n Book\\'s ready!\\nDo not talk to anyone. Do not look at anyone. That is of the utmost importance. You must be invisible. Do you understand?\\nShit.\\nIt\\'s that door. On the left.\\nYou can give us the Book.\\nWe\\'ll give it to her.\\nIt\\'s okay. Come on up.\\nBut I can\\'t... Shh...\\nIt\\'s okay.\\nWhat did you want me to do? Walk out in the middle of a photo shoot?\\nI rushed out of an investment committee meeting early, then I sat there waiting for you for almost an hour...\\nWe were in a loft near the Seaport. My phone didn\\'t work. I told you.\\n...and I knew what everyone in the restaurant was thinking. There he is, waiting for HER again--\\nOkay, before you start freaking out, it wasn\\'t such a big deal. The twins said hello, I said hello back, then I went upstairs and gave the book to Miranda--\\nYou went upstairs? Oh my God. Why didn\\'t you just climb into bed with her and ask for a bedtime story?\\nYou\\'re right. I made a mistake.\\nDon\\'t you understand? If you get fired, that might jeopardize Paris for me. And if that happens, I will search every Blimpie\\'s in the tri-state area until I find you and kill you.\\nWait a second. She\\'s going to fire me?\\nI don\\'t know. She\\'s not happy.\\nAn-dre-a.\\nMiranda, about last night, I--\\nI need the new Harry Potter book for the twins.\\nOf course. I\\'ll run down to Barnes & Noble right now.\\nDid you fall down and smack your little head on the pavement?\\nNot that I can recall.\\nWe have all the published Harry Potter books. The girls want to know what happens next.\\nSo you want the... unpublished manuscript.\\nWe know everyone in publishing. Shouldn\\'t be a problem.  You can do anything, right?\\nShe doesn\\'t get it. There\\'s no way I can get that book. I don\\'t care who I call.\\nMy girls are leaving on the train to their Grandmother\\'s at 3. They\\'ll need the book by then.\\nOf course.\\nI\\'d like my steak in fifteen minutes.\\nNo problem.\\nOh look, you\\'re getting paranoid. Yay. It\\'s not just me. Listen, don\\'t freak out. There could be a silver lining here.\\nOr--\\nOr, you know, that thing you were saying about the cat.\\nIt\\'s for Miranda Priestly... it\\'s very important. Yes, I know, it\\'s impossible to get...\\nAnything? Can you try again? I would really appreciate any leads at all... thanks. No pressure. If I don\\'t have it by 3, I\\'m fired.\\nWhat an amazing job, working for someone like Ms. Priestly.\\nYeah. It\\'s a real party.\\nOf course I remember you, Miranda Girl. You shaken off the college boyfriend yet?\\nListen. I desperately need a favor. And I don\\'t know many people in the book world...\\nThe Harry Potter manuscript? You\\'ve gotta be kidding.\\nJust tell her it can\\'t be done. You\\'ll have to come up with a plan B.\\nWe\\'re talking about Miranda Priestly. There is no plan B, only plan A. 62. The Devil Wears Prada   2nd Blue In Progress   12/00/05\\nIs she back? Am I fired?\\nYou know, I rarely say this to people who aren\\'t me, but you need to calm down.\\nWhat is that doing here? I ordered it ages ago.\\n Can you make it extra hot? Like, center of the sun hot?\\nSounds like a great job.\\nActually, it is. A million girls would kill for it.\\nWant a mocha?\\nQuit? Are you sure?\\nI failed. She\\'s going to fire me anyway. Might as well beat her to the punch.\\nWow. Good for you. Congratulations, Andy. You\\'re free.\\nCall you later.\\nYou didn\\'t.\\nOh yes. A friend of a friend does the cover art. She has the manuscript.\\nNo. That would mean I actually... did something right.  But see... thing is... See, I was about to...\\nYou want this, you better hurry. Meet me at the St. Regis.\\nYes, I\\'m meeting someone...\\nYou have one hour.\\nI\\'m begging you. You have to stall her. Just ten minutes.\\nToo much traffic on 5th. UN\\'s in session.\\nOne copy? What are my twins supposed to do with that... share?\\nActually I made two copies. And had them color-copied, re-set and bound so they wouldn\\'t look like manuscripts.\\nAnd where exactly are those fabulous copies? I don\\'t see them anywhere.\\n Anything else I can do for you?\\nI went over to Dean & DeLuca -- man, they charge like five bucks a strawberry, but I figured, you quit, we should celebrate.\\nListen, Nate--\\nSo you quit, but you\\'re still doing the twins\\' science project. Big of you.\\nAfter I called you, I realized... It doesn\\'t make sense to throw away all these months of hard work. I just had a moment of weakness. That\\'s all.\\nEither that or your job sucks and your boss is a wacko.\\nThat\\'s all it is, Nate. Just a job.\\nNo, no. It\\'s an important magazine. That\\'s what you said, right?\\nI get the point, Nate.\\nThe new Botox. The new pea coat. The new  Gstaad. What the hell is--\\nGstaad. It\\'s a ski resort. In Switzerland.\\nSee? I now live with someone who knows that. Thank you, Miranda Priestly.\\nNate, it\\'s not like I run the magazine. I just work there, remember?\\nThat\\'s the thing -- I liked your old clothes.\\n What about these? These are pretty nice.\\nI like that.\\n...Posen\\'s doing some very sculptural suits, so Testino wants to shoot them at the Noguchi Garden in the Chase building.\\nPerfect. What about the accessories pages for April?\\nOne thought was enamel -- bangles, pendants, earrings--\\nWe did that two years ago. What else?\\nWell, they\\'re showing a lot of florals for spring and so--\\nFlorals. For spring. Groundbreaking.\\nBut we thought about shooting them in an industrial space.\\nNo.\\n--which--\\nNo.\\nAre you okay?\\nTonight\\'s the benefit. I\\'ve been looking forward to it for MONTHS. I refuse to be sick. I\\'m wearing Valentino.  Everyone\\'s going to be leaving to get dressed soon, so after you drop off Miranda\\'s Fendi bag at the re-beaders, you can just go home.\\nGreat. Thanks. That\\'s perfect, because I need to get to Magnolia Bakery before they close...\\nI want to make sure before the benefit that you are both fully prepped on the guest list.\\nUm... I thought only the first assistant went to the benefit.\\nOnly when the first assistant hasn\\'t decided to be disgustingly ill. You\\'ll come and help Emily.\\nI don\\'t see why she needs both of us.\\nDon\\'t look at me. This is the last thing I want to do.\\nThese are all the guests. Miranda invites everyone. We have to make sure they all think she knows exactly who they are. I\\'ve been studying for weeks.\\nI need to learn all these people by tonight?\\nDon\\'t be silly.\\nLily, just start without me. I\\'ll be there as soon as I can.\\nOkay, but hurry.\\nI will. I promise. Believe me, this is the last thing I want to--\\nOf course. A few extra yards of fabric and a staple gun and we\\'re in business.\\nRemember, there are two keys to wearing an evening gown -- one is to maintain a regal bearing. The second--\\n...this benefit is the social event of the season. It represents what Runway is about -- grace, style, elegance...\\nOh my God, Andy. You look... chic.\\nAnd you look... so thin.\\n Do I? It\\'s for Paris. I\\'m on a new diet. I don\\'t eat anything, and then, when I feel like I\\'m about to faint, I eat a cube of cheese.\\nIt\\'s definitely working.\\nI know. I\\'m just one stomach flu away from my goal weight.\\nThat\\'s... great.\\nReady?\\nWe need to make sure we\\'re there the second she walks in.\\nI was wondering how long you think we\\'ll have to stay because I was hoping to--\\nThere she is.\\nJohn. Good to see you.\\nThat\\'s Massimo Cortileono, chairman of-\\n She knows him.\\nMassimo, you made it. I was worried you\\'d be too busy with your new factory in Ortezzano--\\nI would never miss a chance to see you, Miranda, darling.\\n Emily?\\n That\\'s... Wait... I know who that is... It\\'s...\\nAmbassador Franklin. And that\\'s the woman he left his wife for, Rebecca. The woman he\\'s leaving HER for is the man walking down the stairs in Valentino.\\nAmbassador, Rebecca.\\nThanks.\\n That\\'s... Jacqueline Follet, right? From French Runway.\\nYes. Oh my God. Miranda hates her. She was supposed to arrive after Miranda left...\\nAh, Bonsoir, Cherie. Ta robe est rudement chouette.\\nI like your dress too. Very... Americaine. Sportif.\\nThank you for coming to our little get together tonight.\\nOf course. I plan my whole year around it.\\nAnd we\\'re all so grateful.\\nAfter all, we\\'re family, no?\\nAlors, Jacqueline, ditez-moi, avez- vous rencontr Brad Pitt?\\nAh, no... Pas encore...\\nYou can go. I\\'ve got it from here.\\nAre you sure?\\nGo. Have fun.\\n Thank you. Thank you so much.\\nDarling, there you are.\\nIt\\'s a banner evening. Three people have failed to recognize me, one person called me Mr. Priestly, and now the damned bartender refuses to serve me.\\nI\\'m sorry to bother you, but I\\'ve been dying to ask you... Is it true that John Cheever used to ghostwrite the editor\\'s page of Manhattan Magazine in the 50\\'s?...\\nCome on, darling, let\\'s get something to eat. I\\'m starved, aren\\'t you?\\nLook at you... you\\'re a vision. Thank God I saved your job.\\nHey, I figured out a few things on my own, too. Turns out I\\'m not as nice as you thought.\\nGod I hope not.\\nDo you really say things like that to people?\\nEvidently.\\nI have to go...\\nAre you sure? My editor from Vanity Fair is in there and I was going to introduce you to him.  You sent me your stuff, remember? I have to be honest, I only read a couple -- that was quite a big packet - - but they weren\\'t half-bad. You\\'re pretty talented, Andy. He should meet you. Come on in. Just one drink.\\nWell, maybe I could--  No no no. I can\\'t. I just can\\'t.\\nSay hello to the boyfriend for me.\\nCan you go any faster?\\nHappy Birthday.\\nDon\\'t worry about it. I\\'m going to bed.\\nCan we at least talk about it this--\\nYou look really pretty.\\nI don\\'t understand what\\'s so difficult about scheduling a preview. If you want Miranda to give you any editorial, we\\'ll need to see the clothing at least three weeks before the show. Yes, please. See what you can do.\\nEverything okay?\\nYeah. I\\'m... fine.\\nNo, no, no. I think Gisele should be the lizard and Vivian the donkey.\\nThe lizard\\'s better with the Dolce.  Sometimes I can\\'t believe I talk about this crap all day.\\nGet these to Miranda right away. Tell her I switched in the Dior for the Rochas.\\n Great. No problem.\\nHey. Adjust the attitude. Don\\'t make me feed you to one of the models.\\nSorry. Busy day. And my personal life is going down the drain. That\\'s all.\\nJoin the club. You start to do well at work, that\\'s what happens.\\nAndrea. Come up here.\\nParis is the most important week of my year. I need the best team possible with me.\\nWait. You want ME to -- oh, no. No, no. Emily would die. Her whole life is about Paris.\\nIf you don\\'t go, I\\'ll assume you\\'re not serious about your future at Runway or any other publication.\\nBut--\\nThat\\'s all.\\nDon\\'t forget to tell Emily.\\nSorry I\\'m late. Miranda wanted some scarves from Hermes and she told me yesterday but I forgot and so--\\nI freaked out of course, but then I just called Martine at home and she opened the store early, so I got them.\\nOkay. Emily. When you get in, I want to talk to you about something--\\nI hope it\\'s not another Miranda problem--\\nNot exactly.\\nGood. Because I\\'ve got so much to deal with before I go, I swear to God I can\\'t even--\\nI don\\'t care if she was going to fire you or beat you with a red hot poker, you should have said no.\\nI didn\\'t have a choice. You know how she is.\\nOh, please. That\\'s a pathetic excuse.\\nLook, I know you\\'re mad. And I don\\'t blame you.\\nFace it, Andy. You sold your soul the day you put on your first pair of Jimmy Choos.\\nEmily--\\nI said, go!\\nYou\\'re going to Paris for the couture shows? That\\'s the coolest fashion event of the year -- who are you going to see Galliano? Lagerfeld? Nicolas Ghesquiere?\\nOkay, now you\\'re scaring me.\\nI wasn\\'t sure you would be able to make it.\\nWhat are you talking about? I wouldn\\'t miss this.\\nI\\'m just glad you\\'re here. Start with the murals in the other room. They\\'re amazing...\\nHey, Miranda Girl.\\nCome on.\\nIt\\'s true. I\\'m profiling Gaultier for Interview and I was making plans for Paris and found myself wondering if you would be there.\\nActually...\\nThat\\'s great. I\\'m staying at a fantastic little hotel in the Seventh across the street from a falafel restaurant that will change your life.\\nSorry. I\\'ll be too busy working. You\\'ll have to find someone else\\'s life to change.\\nBut that\\'s just it. I\\'m starting to wonder if I can.\\nHe\\'s just a guy I know from work.\\nYeah. That looked like work.\\nYou\\'re making a big a deal out of--\\nThe Andy I know is madly in love with Nate, is always five minutes early and thinks Club Monaco is couture. For the last 16 years I\\'ve known everything about that Andy, but this person?\\nYou\\'re going to Paris?\\nIt just happened--\\nI thought Paris was some big deal for Emily and--\\nGreat. Now you\\'re going to give me a hard time, too?\\nWhat the hell is wrong with you?\\nMiranda asked me and I couldn\\'t say no, okay? I didn\\'t have a choice.\\nI know, I know. That\\'s your answer for everything lately. I didn\\'t have a choice. Like this job was forced on you. Like you don\\'t make these decisions yourself...\\nOkay. I get it, you\\'re mad because I work late all the time, because I missed your birthday party--\\nOh, come on. What am I, four?\\nYou hate Runway. And Miranda. You think fashion is stupid. You\\'ve made that clear.\\nAndy, I make port wine reductions all day. I\\'m not exactly in the Peace Corps. I wouldn\\'t care if you were out all night pole dancing if you did it with some integrity.\\nSo now I have no integrity. Great.\\nYou used to say this was just a job. You made fun of the Runway girls. And now you\\'ve become one of them.\\nThat\\'s absurd.\\nLook at you. Now that I know how much you\\'re willing to change to be successful, it makes me wonder if we ever had anything in common.'"

              "'You don\\'t mean that.\\nI do. I really do.\\nThen maybe this trip is coming at a good time. Maybe we should take a break.\\nIn case you\\'re wondering, the person whose calls you always take, that\\'s the relationship you\\'re in.\\nHello, Miranda...\\nWait. This is not right. Miranda is staying in the suite.\\nThat\\'s correct, Mademoiselle. Miranda Priestly\\'s suite is down the hall.\\nThis is my room?\\nYou know, I\\'ve been thinking, and you still owe me for Harry Potter.\\nOh, do I?\\nOf course you do. You working tonight?\\nActually, Miranda has a dinner.\\nSo you\\'re free. Perfect. Oh, but there\\'s a problem, huh? Le Boyfriend.\\nOh, you\\'re so full of it. You are not desol at all.\\nYeah, not even a little. What time should I pick you up?\\n There you are. We need to go over the seating chart for the luncheon.\\nSure. No problem. I have it right here, um...\\nBy all means, move at a glacial pace. You know how that thrills me.\\nBut your table is full.\\nStephen won\\'t be coming.\\nSo Stephen is not... so you don\\'t need me to fetch Stephen from the airport tomorrow?\\nWell, if you speak to him and he decides to rethink the divorce, then \"fetch\" him. Fetch away.\\nOf course.\\nAnother divorce in the papers... and we all know what they\\'ll say about me - - Dragon Lady, career-obsessed, drove away another \"Mr. Priestly\".\\nMiranda, I\\'m so sorry. If you want me to cancel your evening, I can.\\nDon\\'t be ridiculous... why would you do that?\\nMiranda, is there... is there anything else I can do?\\nYour job.\\n Go.\\nHi. Listen, I need Miranda\\'s itinerary because--\\nWhat do you mean?\\nThat outfit.\\nOh, I just threw it on.\\n Incredible. Well, I guess my work here really is done. Come on. Let\\'s have champagne. We\\'re celebrating.\\nWhat are we toasting?\\nTo getting the dream job, the one a million girls wanted.\\nNigel. I got my job months ago.\\nI\\'m not talking about you.\\n You\\'re leaving? Nigel, I can\\'t imagine Runway without you.\\nCan you believe it? For the first time in eighteen years, I\\'m going to call the shots in my own life. One day I might be able to come to Paris and actually... see Paris.\\nGod. I\\'m so happy for you, Nigel. You deserve it.\\nBet your ass.\\n...I\\'ve never seen anyone as dedicated as Miranda.\\nThat\\'s fantastic. Can we stop talking about her now?\\nI\\'m just saying, yes, there are things she does I don\\'t agree with, but...\\nOh, come on, Andy. You hate her. Just admit it. She\\'s a notorious sadist, and not in the good way.\\nOkay, so she\\'s tough, but if Miranda were a man, no one would notice anything but how great she is at her job.\\nI can\\'t believe this. You\\'re defending her. The wide-eyed girl peddling her earnest newspaper stories -- you\\'re crossing over to the dark side.\\nI resent that.\\nYou shouldn\\'t. It\\'s sexy.\\nSexy? Really?\\nReally.\\nI have no idea where we\\'re going. You could be leading me anywhere...\\nDon\\'t worry. I know this city like the back of my hand. It\\'s my favorite place on the planet. You know what Gertrude Stein said -- \"America is my country and Paris is my hometown.\"\\nYou are unbelievable. Do you write that stuff down and file it away to use on girls?\\nI work free-lance. Leaves me with some time on my hands.\\nWell, I never understood why everyone was so crazy about Paris, but now...\\nThank God.\\nWhat the hell is this?\\nWhat does it look like? It\\'s a mock- up.\\nOf?\\nOf what American Runway will look like when Jacqueline is the new editor-in- chief.\\nThey\\'re replacing Miranda?\\nYes. And she\\'s bringing me in to run all the editorial content.  Are you really surprised? Jacqueline is a lot younger than Miranda. Has a fresher take on things. Not to mention that American Runway is one of the most expensive books in the business. Jacqueline does the same thing with a lot less money. Irv is a businessman, you know.\\nMiranda will be devastated. Runway is her whole life. He can\\'t do that to her.\\nIt\\'s done. Irv\\'s going to tell Miranda after the party for James.\\nAnd she has no idea...?\\nShe\\'s a big girl. She\\'ll be fine.\\nI have to go.\\nIt\\'s done, Andy.\\nOh, thank God. Where are you?\\nExcuse me?\\nI need to talk to you. Right away. It\\'s about Jacqueline Follet, she--\\nExcuse us a moment.\\nI have to talk to you.\\nDo not disturb me again.\\nMiranda, wait. I have to talk to you. You can fire me if you want to after that, but...  Irv is going to make Jacqueline Follet editor-in-chief of Runway. Christian Thompson told me, he\\'s going to work for her. Irv\\'s going to tell you today. I thought if I told you now, you could fix it.\\nAre those freesias?\\nWhat? No. I specifically told them--\\nIf I see freesia anywhere, I will be very disappointed.\\nFor seventy-two years, Runway has been more than a magazine, it\\'s been a beacon of elegance and grace. Miranda Priestly is the finest possible guardian of that beacon, setting a standard that inspires people across the globe. Ladies and gentlemen, I give you Miranda Priestly.\\nThank you everyone. Before I talk to you about James and everything he\\'s accomplished, I have news.\\nYou said it was your dream job.\\nI\\'ve given her everything I have, Andy. She knows that.\\nBut you don\\'t need her. You could just leave anyway and-\\n When the time is right, she\\'ll pay me back.\\nYou sure about that?\\nNo. But I hope for the best. I have to.\\nI\\'m ready to go.\\nYou thought I didn\\'t know.\\nThen I let Irv know Jacqueline was unavailable.\\nAny of his other choices would find the job impossible and the magazine would surely suffer. Especially because of the list--\\n...all of whom have promised to follow me whenever and if ever I leave Runway. To any publication I choose. Of course, as soon as Irv understood, he reconsidered.\\nI must say, I was impressed with you, how intently you tried to warn me.\\nBut I don\\'t think I am like that.\\nOf course you can. You already did. To Emily.\\nThat\\'s not what I -- that was different. I didn\\'t have a choice.\\nNo. You did choose. You chose to get ahead. You want this life, those choices are necessary.\\nBut what if it\\'s not what I want? I mean, what if I don\\'t want to live the way you do?\\nDon\\'t be silly, Andrea. This is what everyone wants. Everyone wants to be us.\\nSorry. Town car\\'s in the shop.\\nYou\\'re such a pain.\\nAnd you\\'d be lost without me.\\nTrue.\\nDoes this mean I have to give my purse back?\\nI have to be at work in ten minutes. What\\'s up?\\nI just wanted to say...\\nShoes. And jackets and belts and--\\nNate, I\\'m just... I\\'m so sorry.\\nI flew up to Boston while you were gone. Interviewed at the Oak Room.\\nAnd?\\nYou\\'re looking at their new sous-chef. I\\'m moving up there in a few weeks.\\nThat\\'s great, I... congratulations.\\nThey have bread in Boston. Might even have Jarlsberg. We might be able to figure something out.\\nYou think?\\nYou never know.\\nNot sure.\\nI\\'m not worried about you. Anything you try, you\\'re gonna kick ass.\\nYou think so?\\nNo. I know it.\\nThanks. I actually have a job interview today.\\nAnd that\\'s what you\\'re wearing? 106A. The Devil Wears Prada   2nd Blue In Progress   12/00/05\\nYou know our pay is crap.\\nThat\\'s fine.\\nYour clips were excellent. That thing on the janitor\\'s union... that\\'s exactly what we do here.\\nLearned a lot. In the end, though, I kind of screwed it up.\\nThat\\'s not what I hear.\\nMy God, you call this a letter? Can you spell any word in the English language?\\nEmily, it\\'s Andy. Don\\'t hang up. I have a favor to ask you.\\nYou\\'re joking. YOU have a favor to ask of ME?\\nThing is, I have all these clothes from Paris and I don\\'t have anyplace to wear them, so I was wondering... is there any way you could take them off my hands?\\nWell, I don\\'t know. It is a huge imposition, but I suppose I could help you out... I\\'ll have Roy pick them up this afternoon.\\nThanks, Emily.

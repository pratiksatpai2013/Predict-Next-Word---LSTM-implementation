# Predict-Next-Word---LSTM-implementation
LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) Networks is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) designed to capture long-term dependencies and patterns in sequential data, addressing the vanishing gradient problem of traditional RNNs. A very good way to understand the working of LSTM is the implementation of the Next Word prediction.
This work involves steps like - 
1. Data Preparation - To train an LSTM for next-word prediction, the text data must be preprocessed and prepared in a specific format that the model can understand.
   a. Text Cleaning and Tokenization
   b. Creating Sequences
   c. Encoding

2. Building the LSTM Model - An LSTM model can be built using frameworks like TensorFlow and Keras. The architecture typically involves:
   a. Model Architecture
   b. Model Compilation

3. Training the Model
4. Making Predictions

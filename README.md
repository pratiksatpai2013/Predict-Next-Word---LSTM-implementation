# Predict-Next-Word---LSTM-implementation
LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) Networks is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) designed to capture long-term dependencies and patterns in sequential data, addressing the vanishing gradient problem of traditional RNNs. A very good way to understand the working of LSTM is the implementation of the Next Word prediction.
